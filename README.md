## IPL Test Vagrant Question
In analyzing a team's performance, one of the methods used is to look at their past performance. In the above details you could see performance of the
past 5 matches for all IPL teams.

PROBLEM TO SOLVE:-

1.) Create a small data structure that holds details- Name of the team, points they have earned and result of last 5 matches as per the above details.
2.) Programmatically retrieve the teams that have 2 consecutive losses.
3.) Generalize the same solution, so that we could get teams that have n consecutive losses/wins.
4.) Once the above is done, calculate the average points of these filtered teams.


## Planetary Program
Solar System's Planets.
PROBLEM TO SOLVE:-

1.) Create a class that holds details of planets- palnet name, planet's surfaces gasses, total number of moons and the planet's having orbital rings.
2.) To fetch a method that has the total count of moons of all the planets which has the ring throught the orbital.
3.) To getch a method that has the MAXMIMUM GAS Compostion found on the planets.


## Song Store

OVERVIEW 

Create an in-memory store for recently played songs that can accommodate N songs per user, with a fixed initial capacity. This store must have the capability to store a list of song-user pairs, with each song linked to a user. It should also be able to fetch recently played songs based on the user and eliminate the least recently played songs when the store becomes full.
 


EXAMPLE:
Illustration, when 4 different songs were played by a user & Initial capacity is 3: 

Let's assume that the user has played 3 songs - S1, S2 and S3. 
• The playlist would look like -> S1,S2,S3 
• When S4 song is played -> S2,S3,S4 
• When S2 song is played -> S3,S4,S2 
• When S1 song is played -> S4,S2,S1 

EXPECTATIONS: 
• Adhere to clean coding standards and principles. OOP is recommended. 

Q.) Generate a best easiest solution for the given question using Core Java using collections approach.

## Installation

Use any IDE'S and Pull the repo's.
